# How Whack works

How to get the most out of your membership and contribute to your community.





The Whack is a hackspace in Wellington

A space where anyone can come to learn, make, or just hang out.

A space with access to 3d printers, sewing machines, laser cutters, CNC machines, soldering stations, and more.

A space to create community through self-guided learning, sharing, and problem solving.
