# Guidelines for Whack

Welcome to Whack! To ensure a positive and productive environment for everyone, please follow these guidelines:

## 1. Respect and Community

- **Don't Be a Jerk**: Treat everyone with kindness and consideration. Negative behavior, harassment, or discrimination will not be tolerated.
- **Respect and Transparency**: Communicate openly and honestly. If you have concerns or issues, discuss them directly and politely with those involved.
- **Don't Touch Others' Projects**: Respect personal projects marked with "DO NOT HACK".
- **Follow Community Decisions**: Abide by any group agreements or decisions made during meetings or discussions.

## 2. Safety First

- **Prioritize Safety**: Always follow safety procedures when using tools and equipment. If you're unsure how to operate something, ask for assistance.
- **No Sleeping in the Space**: The Hackspace is a workspace, not a residence. Please do not sleep or stay overnight.
- **Be Mindful of Noise and Hazards**: If you're about to make loud noises or create potential hazards, inform others and offer protective equipment if necessary.

## 3. Care for the Space

- **Leave It Cleaner Than You Found It**: After working, tidy up your area and clean any equipment used. This helps keep the space welcoming for everyone.
- **Don't Hoard Resources**: Only take the materials and tools you need for your project so others can access them too.
- **Thoughtful Donations**: Only donate items that are needed or useful. If you're unsure whether something is appropriate to donate, please ask first.
- **Avoid Using the Space as Storage**: Do not use the Hackspace to store personal items or as a dumping ground for unwanted materials.

## 4. Participation and Contribution

- **Contribute to the Community**: Share your knowledge, help others, and get involved in projects and events.
- **No Short-Term Memberships for One-Off Projects**: Please don't join solely to complete a single, time-critical project (e.g., outfitting a van). Our community thrives on long-term participation.
- **Use for Prototyping, Not Production**: The Hackspace is intended for learning and creating prototypes, not for commercial manufacturing or mass production.

## 5. General Etiquette

- **Be Excellent to Each Other**: Foster a welcoming and inclusive environment where everyone feels comfortable collaborating.

By adhering to these guidelines, you'll help maintain a safe, respectful, and inspiring space for everyone. Thank you for being a part of our community!
