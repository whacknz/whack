# Guidelines for Whack

Whack is a shared space for creativity, learning, and collaboration. To maintain a productive and safe environment, follow these simple, effective guidelines.

### 1. Respect the Community

- **Be kind.** Treat everyone respectfully. Don’t cause unnecessary conflict.
- **Communicate clearly.** If you change or move something that affects others, inform the group.

### 2. Safety is Priority

- **Know your tools.** Don’t use equipment you haven’t been trained on. If unsure, ask.
- **Protect yourself and others.** Use safety gear and alert others before making loud noises or starting potentially hazardous work.

### 3. Keep the Space Clean

- **Clean up.** Leave your workspace cleaner than you found it. Return tools and materials to their designated places.
- **Don’t hoard.** Take only what you need. Don’t clutter the space with personal items or unnecessary materials.

### 4. Contribute, Don’t Just Consume

- **Be involved.** Share knowledge, help with upkeep, or contribute to projects. The space thrives through participation.
- **No quick, one-off memberships.** The space is for ongoing engagement, not for short-term, urgent projects like fitting out a van.

### 5. Use the Space for Prototyping, Not Production

- **Prototyping only.** The Hackspace is for testing and developing ideas, not for full-scale commercial production.

### 6. Thoughtful Donations Only

- **Don’t dump.** Only donate what’s genuinely needed. If unsure, ask before bringing something into the space.

### 7. The Hackspace is Not a Shelter

- **No sleeping.** This is a workspace, not a place for overnight stays or emergency accommodation.
