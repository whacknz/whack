# Stewardship: Leading by Supporting

In each area of the Hackspace — whether it’s the workshop, textiles room, 3D printing area, laser cutting, co-working space, or kitchen—there is a **steward**. A steward isn’t a manager or ruler but a knowledgeable guide, there to **help, support, and empower**. Their job is to ensure that the space is safe, functional, and accessible, while fostering a culture of learning and collaboration.

## The Role of a Steward

A steward is the **anchor** of a space, someone with deep expertise in the tools, processes, and safety protocols of that area. They don’t control what happens but are the **central point of knowledge**. Need to learn how to use a piece of equipment? Have a question about materials? Want to suggest an improvement? The steward is your go-to.

Stewards lead by example, not by authority. They’re here to serve the community, keeping the space organized, answering questions, and ensuring that everything works smoothly. Think of them as the **guardian** of the space’s potential, helping members unlock their creativity.

## Tool Certification: Safety and Mastery

For tools that require skill or carry risk—like laser cutters, heavy machinery, or power tools—members must be **certified** by the steward before use. Certification ensures two things: that you know how to use the tool safely and that you understand how to maintain it properly.

Once certified, you’re free to use the tool independently, but certification is a **learning partnership** between you and the steward. The goal is not just safety, but mastery—helping you develop confidence and skill with the equipment.

## The Advice Process: Changing the Space

The Hackspace thrives on flexibility and improvement, but with that freedom comes responsibility. When making changes to a space—whether reorganizing, adding equipment, or altering a workflow—members should follow the **advice process**. This means consulting the steward and those who regularly use the space.

You don’t need formal approval, but gathering feedback ensures that the change works for everyone and avoids creating unintended problems. The advice process strengthens collaboration by valuing **collective wisdom** while empowering individual action. It's a way to balance initiative with respect for the community.

## Stewards as Enablers, Not Gatekeepers

Stewards are not the ultimate authority over what happens in the space. Instead, they are **facilitators of knowledge**. Their role is to make sure you have what you need to succeed. They can connect you with resources, help troubleshoot issues, and offer guidance. They ensure the space is organized and that tools are working—but they do not block progress.

Their goal is to **make things easier** for everyone, removing barriers to creativity while ensuring safety and efficiency. If you have an idea or project that could benefit the community, a steward is there to **support your vision**.

## Shared Responsibility: Stewards are Not Your Mum

Stewards are here to help, but they’re **not here to clean up after you**. While they keep the space organized and ensure tools are functioning, it's up to **everyone** to take care of the Hackspace. If you use a tool, put it back. If you make a mess, clean it up. If something breaks, **don’t ignore it** — report it to the steward, or better yet, help fix it.

Stewards are guides, not babysitters. The Hackspace works best when we all pitch in, respect the tools, and keep the space running smoothly. It’s a **shared responsibility** — you’re part of the community, and taking care of the space is everyone’s job. If you expect someone else to handle your mess, you’re breaking [the social contract](../membership/the-social-contract.md).
