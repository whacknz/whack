   2. an **Officer** may exercise that right on behalf of the **Society**.
3. Without limiting the manner in which the **Member**, **Officer**, or **Society** may be given the right to be heard, they must be taken to have been given the right if—

### Person who is subject of complaint has right to be heard

1. This clause applies if a complaint involves an allegation that a **Member**, an **Officer**, or the **Society** (the ‘respondent’)—
   1. has engaged in misconduct; or
   2. has breached, or is likely to breach, a duty under the **Society’s Constitution** or bylaws or this **Act**; or
   3. has damaged the rights or interests of a **Member** or the rights or interests of **Members** generally.
2. The respondent has a right to be heard before the complaint is resolved or any outcome is determined.
3. If the respondent is the **Society**, an **Officer** may exercise the right on behalf of the **Society**.
4. Without limiting the manner in which a respondent may be given a right to be heard, a respondent must be taken to have been given the right if—
   1.  the respondent is fairly advised of all allegations concerning the respondent, with sufficient details and time given to enable the respondent to prepare a response; and
   2.  the respondent has a reasonable opportunity to be heard in writing or at an oral hearing (if one is held); and
   3.  an oral hearing is held if the decision maker considers that an oral hearing is needed to ensure an adequate hearing; and
   4.  an oral hearing (if any) is held before the decision maker; and

2. Disputes must be dealt with under the **Constitution** in a fair, efficient, and effective manner and in accordance with the provisions of the **Act**.

### Society may decide not to proceed further with complaint

Despite the ‘Investigating and determining dispute’ rule above, the **Society** may decide not to proceed further with a complaint if—

1. the complaint is considered to be trivial; or
2. the complaint does not appear to disclose or involve any allegation of the following kind:
   1. that a **Member** or an **Officer** has engaged in material misconduct:
   2. that a **Member**, an **Officer**, or the **Society** has materially breached, or is likely to materially breach, a duty under the **Society**’s **Constitution** or bylaws or the **Act**:
   3. that a **Member**’s rights or interests or **Members**’ rights or interests generally have been materially damaged:
3. the complaint appears to be without foundation or there is no apparent evidence to support it; or
4. the person who makes the complaint has an insignificant interest in the matter; or
5. the conduct, incident, event, or issue giving rise to the complaint has already been investigated and dealt with under the **Constitution**; or
6. there has been an undue delay in making the complaint.

### Society may refer complaint

1. The **Society** may refer a complaint to—
   1. a subcommittee or an external person to investigate and report; or
   2. a subcommittee, an arbitral tribunal, or an external person to investigate and make a decision.
2. The **Society** may, with the consent of all parties to a complaint, refer the complaint to any type of consensual dispute resolution (for example, mediation, facilitation, or a tikanga-based practice).

### Decision makers

A person may not act as a decision maker in relation to a complaint if 2 or more members of the **Committee** or a complaints subcommittee consider that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person may not be—

1. impartial; or
2. able to consider the matter without a predetermined view.

## Liquidation and removal from the register

### Surplus assets

If the **Society** is liquidated or removed from the Register of Incorporated Societies, no distribution shall be made to any **Member,** and if any property remains after the settlement of the **Society’s** debts and liabilities, that property must be used to further a charitable purpose or purposes as defined in section 5(1) of the Charities Act 2005\.

## Alterations to the constitution

### Amending this constitution

All amendments must be made in accordance with this **Constitution**. Any minor or technical amendments shall be notified to **Members** as outlined in section 31 of the **Act**.

The **Society** may amend or replace this **Constitution** at a **General Meeting** by a resolution passed by a two-thirds majority of those **Members** present and voting.

That amendment could be approved by a resolution passed in lieu of a meeting but only if allowed by this **Constitution**.

Any proposed resolution to amend or replace this **Constitution** shall be signed by at least 5 per cent of eligible **Members** and given in writing to the **Committee** at least 28 **Working Days** before the **General Meeting** at which the resolution is to be considered and accompanied by a written explanation of the reasons for the proposal.

At least 14 **Working Days** before the **General Meeting** at which any amendment is to be considered the **Committee** shall give to all **Members** notice of the proposed resolution, the reasons for the proposal, and any recommendations the **Committee** has.

When an amendment is approved by a **General Meeting** it shall be notified to the Registrar of Incorporated Societies in the form and manner specified in the **Act** for registration, and shall take effect from the date of registration.

If the society is registered as a charity under the Charities Act 2005 the amendment shall also be notified to Charities Services as required by section 40 of that Act.
