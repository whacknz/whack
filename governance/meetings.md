# Meetings at Whack

Meetings at Whack exist to support effective collaboration, decision-making, and progress on shared goals. They are a tool for coordination, not control, and focus on clear outcomes with minimal structure.

## Purpose

Meetings serve to:

- Make decisions on matters that affect the entire group.
- Share information on ongoing projects or issues.
- Resolve conflicts that can’t be handled informally.

The goal is to move quickly and decisively, without unnecessary debate or bureaucracy.

## Structure

### 1. Agenda

- Any member can propose agenda items.
- The agenda is shared in advance, with clear objectives for each item.
- Only items that require group input or impact core functions of the space are discussed.

### 2. Facilitation

- A facilitator (usually the Chairperson) keeps the meeting focused and efficient.
- They guide the discussion, ensure everyone has a chance to speak, and help resolve points of contention.
- The facilitator doesn’t make decisions but ensures the group stays on track.

### 3. Decision-Making

- Most decisions are made using the **"no objections"** model: if no one raises a serious concern, the decision moves forward.
- If there are objections, the group works toward a solution or compromise.
- In cases where consensus can’t be reached, a vote is held, and the majority decision stands.

### 4. Participation

- All members can contribute equally, whether present in person or by proxy.
- Everyone is expected to keep contributions brief and relevant.
- Discussions focus on actions and solutions, not prolonged debate.

### 5. Outcomes

- Every meeting ends with clear next steps, assigned responsibilities, and deadlines.
- Meeting minutes document decisions and action items and are shared with all members for transparency.

## Handling Conflict

- Conflicts are resolved by direct discussion during meetings, focusing on solutions rather than blame.
- The facilitator ensures conflicts are addressed constructively and efficiently, without derailing the meeting.

## Flexibility

- Meetings are as short and focused as possible, adapting to the needs of the group.
- Only issues that require collective input are brought to meetings, leaving individual members free to act where appropriate.
