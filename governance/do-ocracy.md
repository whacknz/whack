# Do-ocracy: How Things Get Done

A **do-ocracy** is a system where authority comes from *taking action*. It’s a structure where the people who make decisions are the ones actually doing the work. Instead of waiting for permission or consensus, you have the freedom to act, with the responsibility to do so wisely.

## Action Creates Authority

In a do-ocracy, decisions are made by those who act. If you see something that needs doing, **take the initiative**. You don’t need to wait for a committee, vote, or approval. Your ability to act gives you authority over that task or project.

## The Advice Process: Wisdom Before Action

Before making significant decisions — especially ones that impact others — **seek advice**. This doesn’t mean asking for permission, but getting feedback from those with more experience or those affected by your actions. By gathering diverse perspectives, you’ll refine your idea and increase the chances of success, while also reducing potential friction.

## Consent, Not Consensus

**Consensus** — where everyone must agree — can stall progress and lead to compromises nobody loves. Instead, we practice **consent**: if there are no strong objections, you’re free to proceed. This keeps things moving while still respecting the voices of those who may be affected. Consent is about listening to concerns, not demanding unanimous approval.

## Focus on What Matters (Avoid Bikeshedding)

People often get stuck on trivial decisions — like the color of a bike shed — while ignoring more critical issues. This is called **bikeshedding**. Do-ocracy means focusing on **meaningful decisions** and not wasting time on things that don’t really matter. Spend your energy where it counts.

## Embrace Failure, Iterate Quickly

Mistakes happen, and that’s okay. In a do-ocracy, action is valued over perfection. If you try something and it doesn’t work, **learn from it and improve**. What’s critical is taking responsibility for your actions and being open to feedback and adaptation. Progress comes through experimentation and iteration.

## Trust, Accountability, and Transparency

A do-ocracy thrives on trust. You’re trusted to act in the best interests of the group, and others will trust that you’ve considered the broader impact of your actions. In return, **be transparent** about what you’re doing. Share your progress, solicit input, and ensure that everyone is aware of major changes. This fosters a culture of mutual respect and accountability.

## Know the Limits

While do-ocracy encourages action, there are **boundaries**. If your actions are irreversible or affect the community in significant ways, it’s your responsibility to get feedback and seek input before proceeding. **No single person** should make decisions that could fundamentally alter the space or the group without collaboration.
