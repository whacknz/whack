# Do-ocracy

A *do-ocracy* is a system where action drives decisions. If you see something that needs doing, and you're willing to do it, you have the power to make it happen. Instead of waiting for approval, you take initiative.

## How It Works

In a do-ocracy, responsibility lies with the person who takes action. If you want to make a change, you are free to do so. Once you've done something, share what you did and why. This keeps everyone informed and encourages feedback.

If your action affects others, you’re expected to ask for advice from those impacted or with relevant expertise. You don’t need permission, but consulting others helps build trust and make sure everyone is on the same page.

## When to Use It

Do-ocracy works best for tasks where immediate action can be taken and where the consequences aren’t permanent. If what you’re doing is complex or hard to undo, check in with the group. If you want to experiment or create something new, go for it—just let others know.

## Respecting Contributions

Those who do the work have authority over it. Their experience and effort give them influence, but this is not about controlling others. It’s about fostering initiative and recognizing effort. You trust that those who take action have the community's best interest in mind.

## When Not to Use It

There are times when more input is needed—like big decisions or irreversible changes. In these cases, gather advice and discuss it openly with the group. If the change impacts many people, ensure everyone has a chance to weigh in.
