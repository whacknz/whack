# The Whack Social Contract

## The membership agreement

As a member, I agree to **respect** the rights of others.

I understand that Whack is a **community** and use of Whack facilities constitutes participation in that community. I agree that assault, hate speech or any generally offensive or oppressive behavior that makes other
members and/or guests feel unwelcome in the community shall not be tolerated.

I agree to observe the rules established by the membership and officers and I understand that those rules have been established so that Whack can function legally, independently and safely.

I hereby certify that I will **not be a jerk** while at or around Whack or at any Whack related event.

## Respect

### Respect Yourself

- **Wear safety gear**: Always protect yourself when working with tools or equipment.
- **Operate tools only when sober**: Ensure you’re in a clear state of mind to keep yourself and others safe.
- **Eat and drink when needed**: Take care of your health and well-being while working on projects.
- **Manage your emotions**: Don’t let frustration or anger dictate your actions—step back if you need to.
- **Embrace mistakes**: This is a space for learning, and making mistakes is part of that process. No one expects perfection.

### Respect Others

- **Collaboration requires patience**: Sharing tools, time, and space can be challenging. Work together with an open mind.
- **Communicate respectfully**: Even when tensions run high, speak calmly and treat everyone with respect.
- **Set clear boundaries**: Be direct but respectful when stating your needs or limitations. Mutual understanding builds a stronger community.
- **Help when asked, but respect autonomy**: Offer assistance, but allow others to explore, experiment, and make their own decisions.

### Respect the Space

- **Clean up after yourself**: Leave enough time at the end of your session to tidy up your area. Plan this into your project workflow.
- **Leave the space better than you found it**: Take small actions that improve the space for everyone, whether it’s organizing tools or cleaning up a shared area.
- **Follow space-specific guidelines**: Each part of the Hackspace may have its own etiquette or rules—learn them and follow them to keep things running smoothly.
- **Be mindful of shared resources**: Use tools and materials responsibly, knowing that others need them too.

## Transparency

Say what you are going to do, do what you say,

and when it changes say that too!

## Safety

See [./safety/README.md] for more on how to be practice safe hack-making.

## It's okay to make a mistake

It’s okay to make a mistake

Fostering a culture where it is okay to make a mistake is an important part of Whack culture. Some of the best lessons learned are from when things don’t go well.

Whack is also a safe place to learn and make mistakes while making.

Whack is not a private space. What we do here is seen by the rest of the folks using this small space.

Part of transparency is being clear and owning our actions and their impact on the group. It is okay to be human. Successful sharing relies on communication.

## Make Whack Possible

All members are expected to contribute.
